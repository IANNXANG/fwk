Perhaps it means the bookshelf has **two shelves**, and the 15 books are to be arranged **in pairs** on these shelves.\n- The phrase **\"if some books have been removed\"** suggests we are to consider the number of arrangements **after removing some books**.\n\nLet’s assume the following interpretation:\n\n- There is a **bookshelf with two shelves**.\n- The **15 books** are to be arranged **in pairs** on the shelves.\n- Since 15 is odd, we can't divide them evenly into pairs.

Let's clarify.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Clarify the meaning of \"7 additional steps\"\n\nThe phrase **\"7 additional steps that need to be taken before reaching g\"** is a bit ambiguous.

The student must take a total of **7 steps** to get from **e to g**, and the path must go through **f**, which is 3 units from **e** and 5 units from **g**.\n\nThis suggests a **grid-like path**, where the student moves in a 2D plane, and the total number of steps is fixed.\n\nLet’s assume the student is moving on a grid from **e to g**, and the path must go through **f**, which is 3 units from **e** and 5 units from **g**.\n\nThis is a classic **combinatorics** problem: the number of paths from **e to g** that go through **f**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use the **multiplication principle**\n\nLet’s suppose the student is moving on a grid, and the total number of steps from **e to g** is **8** (3 to f, 5 to g). So the total number of steps is:\n\n$$\n3 + 5 = 8\n$$\n\nAssume the student is moving in a 2D grid, and the path from **e to f** is 3 steps, and from **f to g** is 5 steps.

That is, the triangle can be rotated so that the leg of 5 units is **not necessarily adjacent** to the right angle.\n\nSo, we can consider two cases:\n\n#### Case 1: The leg of 5 is one of the legs (not the hypotenuse)\n\nThen the other leg is $ x $, and we have:\n\n$$\nx^2 + 5^2 = 6^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 11 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.316\n$$\n\nSo the other leg is approximately 3.316.\n\n#### Case 2: The leg of 5 is the **hypotenuse**, and the other leg is 6\n\nThen the third side is:\n\n$$\nx^2 + 6^2 = 5^2 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 25 - 36 = -11\n$$\n\nThis is **not possible**, since we can't have a negative square.\n\nSo the leg of 5 **cannot** be the hypotenuse.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the triangle in 3D or with variable orientation\n\nLet’s now consider the triangle in a more general way.\n\nLet’s suppose the triangle is in 3D space, and the hypotenuse is fixed at 6 units, and one leg is fixed at 5 units. The triangle can be rotated in space, and the third side (the other leg) can vary in length.\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nLet’s fix the hypotenuse as a vector of length 6, and one leg as a vector of length 5. The angle between them can vary, and the third side (the other leg) will vary accordingly.\n\nLet’s use the **Law of Cosines** to find the possible lengths of the third side.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- $ a = 5 $ (one leg)\n- $ c = 6 $ (hypotenuse)\n- $ b $ = the other leg (unknown)\n- $ \\theta $ = angle between the two legs\n\nThen by the Law of Cosines:\n\n$$\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos\\theta\n$$\n\nWe can solve for $ b $:\n\n$$\n6^2 = 5^2 + b^2 - 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot b \\cdot \\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\n36 = 25 + b^2 - 10b\\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\nb^2 - 10b\\cos\\theta + 25 - 36 = 0\n$$\n$$\nb^2 - 10b\\cos\\theta - 11 = 0\n$$\n\nThis is a quadratic in $ b $:\n\n$$\nb^2 - 10b\\cos\\theta - 11 = 0\n$$\n\nWe can solve for $ b $ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nb = \\frac{10\\cos\\theta \\pm \\sqrt{(10\\cos\\theta)^2 + 44}}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\nb = \\frac{10\\cos\\theta \\pm \\sqrt{100\\cos^2\\theta + 44}}{2}\n$$\n\nNow, since $ \\cos\\theta \\in [-1, 1] $, we can find the **minimum and maximum possible values of $ b $** by plugging in the extreme values of $ \\cos\\theta $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find the range of possible values of $ b $\n\nLet’s define:\n\n$$\nb = \\frac{10\\cos\\theta \\pm \\sqrt{100\\cos^2\\theta + 44}}{2}\n$$\n\nWe want to find the **minimum and maximum possible values of $ b $** as $ \\cos\\theta $ varies from -1 to 1.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n$$\nf(\\cos\\theta) = \\frac{10\\cos\\theta + \\sqrt{100\\cos^2\\theta + 44}}{2}\n$$\n\n$$\ng(\\cos\\theta) = \\frac{10\\cos\\theta - \\sqrt{100\\cos^2\\theta + 44}}{2}\n$$\n\nWe want to find the **maximum and minimum values of $ b $** over $ \\cos\\theta \\in [-1, 1] $.\n\nLet’s compute the **maximum** and **minimum** of $ f(\\cos\\theta) $ and $ g(\\cos\\theta) $.\n\n#### Try $ \\cos\\theta = 1 $:\n\n$$\nf(1) = \\frac{10 + \\sqrt{100 + 44}}{2} = \\frac{10 + \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{10 + 12}{2} = 11\n$$\n\n$$\ng(1) = \\frac{10 - \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{10 - 12}{2} = -1\n$$\n\n#### Try $ \\cos\\theta = -1 $:\n\n$$\nf(-1) = \\frac{-10 + \\sqrt{100 + 44}}{2} = \\frac{-10 + 12}{2} = 1\n$$\n\n$$\ng(-1) = \\frac{-10 - \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{-10 - 12}{2} = -11\n$$\n\nSo the **possible values of $ b $** range from **-11 to 11**, but since we are looking for **positive integral values**, we consider only the **positive values**.\n\nFrom the above, the **possible positive values of $ b $** are from **1 to 11**.\n\nSo the **greatest possible integral value** is **11**, and the **least possible integral value** is **1**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Find the positive difference\n\n$$\n\\text{Positive difference} = 11 - 1 = \\boxed{10}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "qwen_token_count": 1636}

For it to have **exactly one solution**, the **discriminant** must be 0.\n\nDiscriminant:\n\n$$\nD = (2a)^2 - 4(1)(3a - 2) = 4a^2 - 12a + 8\n$$\n\nSet $ D = 0 $:\n\n$$\n4a^2 - 12a + 8 = 0\n\\Rightarrow a^2 - 3a + 2 = 0\n\\Rightarrow (a - 1)(a - 2) = 0\n\\Rightarrow a = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = 2\n$$\n\nSo for $ a = 1 $ or $ a = 2 $, the equation $ x^2 + 2ax + 3a = 2 $ has **exactly one solution**.\n\nNow check the other equation:\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Solve $ x^2 + 2ax + 3a = -2 $\n\n$$\nx^2 + 2ax + 3a + 2 = 0\n\\Rightarrow x^2 + 2ax + (3a + 2) = 0\n$$\n\nDiscriminant:\n\n$$\nD = (2a)^2 - 4(1)(3a + 2) = 4a^2 - 12a - 8\n$$\n\nSet $ D = 0 $:\n\n$$\n4a^2 - 12a - 8 = 0\n\\Rightarrow a^2 - 3a - 2 = 0\n\\Rightarrow a = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}\n$$\n\nSo for these values of $ a $, the equation $ x^2 + 2ax + 3a = -2 $ has **exactly one solution**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Combine both conditions\n\nWe want the **inequality", "qwen_token_count": 2043}
